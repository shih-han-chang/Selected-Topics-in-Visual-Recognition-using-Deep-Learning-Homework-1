# Selected-Topics-in-Visual-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning-Homework-1  
  The target of homework 1 is car brand classification and the dataset include 16,185 car images belonging to 196 classes.

## Hardware   
  Use Google Colab to train this model  

## Dataset
  The dataset include 16,185 car images. The datase can be classify to 196 classes. 
  * The training data have 11,185 images with a label file
  * The test data have 5000 image. 
  
## Description of code 
  Because I use the Google Colab to train this model, HW1.ipynb includes all blocks to implement classification. It can be divided into four parts data pre-procese, output testing result, training, and main function(I use comment to label different part in the file). The main function includes data augmentation, model defined and the setting of optimization function.
